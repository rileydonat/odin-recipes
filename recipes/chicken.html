        <p>Cut down on oil by making "fried" chicken in the oven. 
        This oven-fried chicken recipe, made with simple ingredients you probably already have on hand, 
        is as good as it gets.</p>

        <p>I love fried chicken, but it takes so long and is such a big mess.  
        I came up with this oven-fried version, and have been making it ever since! 
        Everyone I have given the recipe to has loved it as well.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>    
            <li>12 chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place flour in a shallow plate or bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. 
                Put bread crumbs in another shallow plate or bowl and beat eggs in another bowl.</li>
            <li>Dredge chicken piece by piece in the flour, then the egg, then the bread crumbs, 
                until all pieces are coated.</li>
            <li>Pour oil into a large baking dish; add the breaded chicken thighs 
                and sprinkle with paprika to taste.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then turn pieces over and bake for another 30 minutes. 
                Remove from the oven and drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
