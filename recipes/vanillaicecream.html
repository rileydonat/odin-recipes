    <h2>Delicious homemade ice cream for the whole family!</h2>
        
        <p>This homemade ice cream is easy to make with just 4 ingredients: pure vanilla extract,
             milk, heavy whipping cream, and sugar. This American or Philadelphia-style ice cream 
             makes for a brighter, more pronounced vanilla flavor.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>    
            <li>2 1/4 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir milk, cream, and sugar in a saucepan over low heat until sugar has dissolved. 
                Heat just until the mixture is hot and a small ring of foam appears around the edge.</li>
            <li>Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large measuring cup. Stir in 
                vanilla extract and chill mix thoroughly, at least 2 hours. (Overnight is best.)</li>
            <li>Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine, and churn 
                according to manufacturer's directions, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or place a piece of plastic wrap 
                directly on the ice cream and place in the freezer to ripen, 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        </ol>
