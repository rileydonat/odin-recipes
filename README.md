HTML practice with some quick recipes

Started with Index.html as a very simple homepage. Then created a new directory for the three recipe pages. Created another simple html page for a fried chicken recipe. Included different headers, some paragraph text, a photo, and both an ordered and unordered list for the steps and ingridients respectively. 

Copying the chicken recipe's page made the other two recipes a matter of simply changing text to ensure the proper photos and text were displayed for the correct recipe. After creating all the recipe pages I made an unordered list for the anchors/links to the recipes to be accessed  on the homepage.
